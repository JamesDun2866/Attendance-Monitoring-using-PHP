#Web Technologies ACW - Creating a location tracking service for student attendace. 
Developed in PHP

- THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES CONNECTION TO HULL UNI DATABASES. WAMP UPGRADE MAY BE CONSIDERED


- This Program is fully validated and certain functions like edit and creating staff users are only available to staff members.
- You will need a staff ID to use them 
- StudentID for all intents and purposes is also StaffID
- I inserted a value into the database with the following values
- Student ID (123456789), FirstName (Bing), Surname (Wang), LocationOfStudent (Venn), UserType (Staff), CurrentDate (SYSDATETIME())
